# MLR-SHOP ( Mum Loves Representation - Shop )
MLR-SHOP is an ecommerce store for black, brown, and diverse dolls. It was inspired by my need for my daughter to have a soft doll that represented her.

As a black woman and mother, after unsuccessfully finding a soft black girl doll that reflected her, I began to reflect on the experiences I had growing up as a little black girl. A few of the memories that came back to me, was the lack of representation in the toys/ dolls that I played with, and how that impacted my identity and love of myself growing up.   

I loved playing with dolls, and nothing I had, or was given, looked like me. Consequently, I found myself wanting to look like my white girl dolls instead. I wanted to change who I was and what I looked like, to reflect the dolls that I saw.

I want my little girl and so many others out there to have a soft doll that represents them and how they look. It is easy to get one’s hands-on white dolls, and that fact is just taken for granted.

My mission is to get black, brown, and diverse dolls in the hands of our children and help them explore their imaginations and create stories that include dolls of all colours, so that they know that everyone counts, no matter the shade of their skin.

Dolls and toys, play a big part in shaping a child's childhoods. Even though to us it is just playing, if you really listen to them, you can hear how they view the world, what they think, how they feel and see them shaping and re-imagining the world around them. It is because of this, and my need for my little girl to see herself as beautiful with her melanin rich skin tone, that I made these dolls.

I hope that everyone black, brown or white, that have children, will recognize that your child having and playing with a beloved black doll along with their other dolls, can help them delight in the celebration of others who are also black in real life.

Let us educate our children to celebrate and love our differences.

![Responsive Mockup](documentation/testing/amiresponsive-pg.png)

The Responsive Mockup image above shows how responsive the MLR-SHOP is across various device screen sizes ranging from mobile devices to large monitor screens. The Mum Loves Representation shop is well layed out with a bold font style used across all pages. The buttons are very legible on all the screen sizes. 

## UX

### Colour Scheme Used

I chose to use a black and white colour scheme for the website - Black for the texts, borders, buttons and icons. White for the overly. For the shop now button on the home page, the colours were switched. I used a background image for the home page to give an infusion of some bright colours. Using black and white colour combination helps in adding dramatic areas of contrast since they are very contrasting colours. This contrast helps to direct users attenton to key areas of each web page, to ensure that the maximum amount of information and content is noticed. Black and white don’t generally count as colours, so they serve as great base colours that can be paired well with other colours. They add an understated simplicity to the website making it look as minimalistic as possible.

### Typography

I chose to use the Lato google font for the primary headers and titles and also for the secondary text. The Lato font is well known for its round edges and the approachable warmth it gives to the reader. Its typeface helps deliver information directly. The Lato font works transparently in body text and also stands out individually when used in larger-sized titles. I used font awesome icons through the site for icons such as the lock icon on the secure checkout button and the chevron icon on the keep shopping button. Font awesome icons are very easy to use compared to other alternatives. They allow for flexibility of styling using css since they are treated as actual text. They are compatible with many browsers.

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for the primary headers and titles and also for the secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the lock icon on the secure checkout button and the chevron icon on the keep shopping button.

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/onabz/mlr-shop/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.

![Github Projects](documentation/testing/github_projects.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/onabz/mlr-shop/issues) served as another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

It also helped with milestone iterations on a weekly basis.

- [Open Issues](https://github.com/onabz/mlr-shop/issues)

    ![Open Issue](documentation/testing/gh-issue-opened.png)

- [Closed Issues](https://github.com/onabz/mlr-shop/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

    ![Closed Issue](documentation/testing/gh-issue-closed.png)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 80% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~10% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*5% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration

## Ecommerce Business Model

This site sells goods to individual customers, and therefore follows a `Business to Customer` model.
It is of the simplest **B2C** forms, as it focuses on individual transactions, and doesn't need anything
such as monthly/annual subscriptions.

It is still in its early development stages, although it already has a newsletter, and links for social media marketing.

Social media can potentially build a community of users around the business, and boost site visitor numbers, especially when using larger platforms such a Facebook.

A newsletter list can be used by the business to send regular messages to site users.
For example, what items are on special offer, new items in stock,
updates to business hours, notifications of events, and much more!

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO) & Social Media Marketing

### Keywords

I've identified some appropriate keywords to align with my site, that should help users
when searching online to find my page easily from a search engine.
This included a series of the following keyword types

- Short-tail (head terms) keywords
- Long-tail keywords

I also played around with [Word Tracker](https://www.wordtracker.com) a bit
to check the frequency of some of my site's primary keywords (only until the free trial expired).

### Sitemap

I've used [XML-Sitemaps](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com) to generate a sitemap.xml file.
This was generated using my deployed site URL: https://mlr-shop.herokuapp.com

After it finished crawling the entire site, it created a
[sitemap.xml](sitemap.xml) which I've downloaded and included in the repository.

### Robots

I've created the [robots.txt](robots.txt) file at the root-level.
Inside, I've included the default settings:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow:
Sitemap: https://mlr-shop.herokuapp.com/sitemap.xml
```

Further links for future implementation:
- [Google search console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
- [Creating and submitting a sitemap](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/sitemaps/build-sitemap)
- [Managing your sitemaps and using sitemaps reports](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451001)
- [Testing the robots.txt file](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062598)

### Social Media Marketing

Creating a strong social base (with participation) and linking that to the business site can help drive sales.
Using more popular providers with a wider user base, such as Facebook, typically maximizes site views.

Below is a link to a live Facebook business page with the same ethos as this site.

[Facebook Business page](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100068065985462)

I've created a mockup Facebook business account using the
[Balsamiq template](https://code-institute-org.github.io/5P-Assessments-Handbook/files/Facebook_Mockups.zip)
provided by Code Institute.

![screenshot](documentation/testing/fb-business-pg-mockup.png)

### Newsletter Marketing

I have incorporated a newsletter sign-up form on my application, to allow users to supply their
email address if they are interested in learning more.

| `DATABASE_URL` | "insert-your-own" |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | "insert-your-own" |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | "insert-your-own" |
| `SECRET_KEY` | "insert-your-own" |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:
- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:
- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:
- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "insert-your-own")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "insert-your-own")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "insert-your-own")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "insert-your-own")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "insert-your-own")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "insert-your-own")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "insert-your-own")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "insert-your-own")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:
- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:
- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/onabz/mlr-shop) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/onabz/mlr-shop.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/onabz/mlr-shop)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!
