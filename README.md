# Mum Loves Representation Shop
Mum Loves Representation is an e commerce store for black, brown, and diverse dolls. It is owned by an African British Mum(Tomi) who wants her little girl to be able to play with a heirloom doll that represents her as she grows and plays imaginatively. She believes that all children should play with black dolls for the purpose of encouraging diversity. She feels that  brown dolls, black dolls, and ethnic dolls are often left upon the shelf, untouched and ignored while it is easy to get one's hands-on white dolls. 

![Responsive Mockup]()

The Responsive Mockup image above shows how responsive the Mum Loves Representation shop is across various device screen sizes ranging from mobile devices to large monitor screens. The Mum Loves Representation shop is well layed out with a bold font style used across all pages. The buttons are very legible on all the screen sizes.

## Deployment

The app was deployed to Heroku. There are four stages:
  - Create the Heroku app,
  - Attach the database,
  - Prepare our environment and settings.py file,
  - Get our static and media files stored on Cloudinary.

- Create the Heroku app:
  - In Heroku.com create new Heroku App - APP_NAME, Location = Europe.
  - Add Database to App Resources - Located in the Resources Tab, Add-ons, search and add e.g. 'Heroku Postgres'.
  - Copy DATABASE_URL value - Located in the Settings Tab, click reveal Config Vars, Copy Text.
   
- Attach the Database:
  - In gitpod:
    - Create new env.py file on top level directory - E.g. env.py

  - In env.py:
    - Import os library - import os
    - Set environment variables - os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "Paste in Heroku DATABASE_URL Link"
    - Add in secret key - os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "Make up your own randomSecretKey"

  - In heroku.com:
    - Add Secret Key to Config Vars - SECRET_KEY, "randomSecretKey"

- Prepare our environment and settings.py file:
    - In settings.py:
      - Reference env.py -  
        ```python                    
        from pathlib import Path
        import os
        import dj_database_url

        if os.path.isfile("env.py"):
          import env
        ```
      - Remove the insecure secret key and replace - links to the SECRET_KEY variable on Heroku - `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`
      - Comment out the old DataBases Section - 
        ```python
        # DATABASES = {
        #     'default': {
        #         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        #         'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        #     }
        # }
        ```
      - Add new DATABASES Section ( - links to the DATATBASE_URL variable on Heroku) - 
        ```python
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
        }
        ```
    - In the Terminal:
      - Save all files and Make Migrations - `python3 manage.py migrate`
  
  - Get our static and media files stored on Cloudinary:
    - In Cloudinary.com:
      - Copy your CLOUDINARY_URL e.g. API Environment Variable - From Cloudinary Dashboard
    - In env.py:
     - Add Cloudinary URL to env.py - be sure to paste in the correct section of the link - `os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "cloudinary://************************"`
    - In Heroku:
      - Add DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC to Heroku Config Vars (temporary step for the moment, will be removed before deployment - e.g. `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC`, `1`
    - In settings.py:
      - Add Cloudinary Libraries to installed apps - 
        ```python                                            
        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            …,
            'cloudinary_storage',
            'django.contrib.staticfiles',
            'cloudinary',
            …,
        ]
        ```
        (note: order is important)
      - Tell Django to use Cloudinary to store media and static files (Place under the Static files) - 
        ```python
        STATIC_URL = '/static/'

        STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
        STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]
        STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

        MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
        DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
        ```
      - Link file to the templates directory in Heroku (Place under the BASE_DIR line) - 
        `TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')`
      - Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR (Place within the TEMPLATES array) - 
        ```python
        TEMPLATES = [
          {
            …,
            'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR],
            …,
          },
        ]
        ```
      - Add Heroku Hostname to ALLOWED_HOSTS - `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['marblog.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']`
    - In Gitpod:
      - Create 3 new folders on top level directory - media, static, templates
      - Create procfile on the top level directory - Procfile
    - In Procfile:
      - Add code - `web: gunicorn marblog.wsgi`
    - Note: Save all files
    -  In the Terminal:
      - Add, Commit and Push - 
      ```bash
      git add .
      git commit -m "Deployment Commit"
      git push
      ```
    - In Heroku:
      - Deploy Content manually through heroku.
