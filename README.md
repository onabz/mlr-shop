# MLR-SHOP ( Mum Loves Representation - Shop )
MLR-SHOP is an ecommerce store for black, brown, and diverse dolls. It was inspired by my need for my daughter to have a soft doll that represented her.

As a black woman and mother, after unsuccessfully finding a soft black girl doll that reflected her, I began to reflect on the experiences I had growing up as a little black girl. A few of the memories that came back to me, was the lack of representation in the toys/ dolls that I played with, and how that impacted my identity and love of myself growing up.   

I loved playing with dolls, and nothing I had, or was given, looked like me. Consequently, I found myself wanting to look like my white girl dolls instead. I wanted to change who I was and what I looked like, to reflect the dolls that I saw.

I want my little girl and so many others out there to have a soft doll that represents them and how they look. It is easy to get one’s hands-on white dolls, and that fact is just taken for granted.

My mission is to get black, brown, and diverse dolls in the hands of our children and help them explore their imaginations and create stories that include dolls of all colours, so that they know that everyone counts, no matter the shade of their skin.

Dolls and toys, play a big part in shaping a child's childhoods. Even though to us it is just playing, if you really listen to them, you can hear how they view the world, what they think, how they feel and see them shaping and re-imagining the world around them. It is because of this, and my need for my little girl to see herself as beautiful with her melanin rich skin tone, that I made these dolls.

I hope that everyone black, brown or white, that have children, will recognize that your child having and playing with a beloved black doll along with their other dolls, can help them delight in the celebration of others who are also black in real life.

Let us educate our children to celebrate and love our differences.

![Responsive Mockup]()

The Responsive Mockup image above shows how responsive the MLR-SHOP is across various device screen sizes ranging from mobile devices to large monitor screens. The Mum Loves Representation shop is well layed out with a bold font style used across all pages. The buttons are very legible on all the screen sizes. 

## UX

### Colour Scheme Used

I chose to use a black and white colour scheme for the website - Black for the texts, borders, buttons and icons. White for the overly. For the shop now button on the home page, the colours were switched. I used a background image for the home page to give an infusion of some bright colours. Using black and white colour combination helps in adding dramatic areas of contrast since they are very contrasting colours. This contrast helps to direct users attenton to key areas of each web page, to ensure that the maximum amount of information and content is noticed. Black and white don’t generally count as colours, so they serve as great base colours that can be paired well with other colours. They add an understated simplicity to the website making it look as minimalistic as possible.

### Typography

I chose to use the Lato google font for the primary headers and titles and also for the secondary text. The Lato font is well known for its round edges and the approachable warmth it gives to the reader. Its typeface helps deliver information directly. The Lato font works transparently in body text and also stands out individually when used in larger-sized titles. I used font awesome icons through the site for icons such as the lock icon on the secure checkout button and the chevron icon on the keep shopping button. Font awesome icons are very easy to use compared to other alternatives. They allow for flexibility of styling using css since they are treated as actual text. They are compatible with many browsers.

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for the primary headers and titles and also for the secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the lock icon on the secure checkout button and the chevron icon on the keep shopping button.

## Deployment

The app was deployed to Heroku. There are four stages:
  - Create the Heroku app,
  - Attach the database,
  - Prepare our environment and settings.py file,
  - Get our static and media files stored on Cloudinary.

- Create the Heroku app:
  - In Heroku.com create new Heroku App - APP_NAME, Location = Europe.
  - Add Database to App Resources - Located in the Resources Tab, Add-ons, search and add e.g. 'Heroku Postgres'.
  - Copy DATABASE_URL value - Located in the Settings Tab, click reveal Config Vars, Copy Text.
   
- Attach the Database:
  - In gitpod:
    - Create new env.py file on top level directory - E.g. env.py

  - In env.py:
    - Import os library - import os
    - Set environment variables - os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "Paste in Heroku DATABASE_URL Link"
    - Add in secret key - os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "Make up your own randomSecretKey"

  - In heroku.com:
    - Add Secret Key to Config Vars - SECRET_KEY, "randomSecretKey"

- Prepare our environment and settings.py file:
    - In settings.py:
      - Reference env.py -  
        ```python                    
        from pathlib import Path
        import os
        import dj_database_url

        if os.path.isfile("env.py"):
          import env
        ```
      - Remove the insecure secret key and replace - links to the SECRET_KEY variable on Heroku - `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`
      - Comment out the old DataBases Section - 
        ```python
        # DATABASES = {
        #     'default': {
        #         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        #         'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        #     }
        # }
        ```
      - Add new DATABASES Section ( - links to the DATATBASE_URL variable on Heroku) - 
        ```python
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
        }
        ```
    - In the Terminal:
      - Save all files and Make Migrations - `python3 manage.py migrate`
  
  - Get our static and media files stored on Cloudinary:
    - In Cloudinary.com:
      - Copy your CLOUDINARY_URL e.g. API Environment Variable - From Cloudinary Dashboard
    - In env.py:
     - Add Cloudinary URL to env.py - be sure to paste in the correct section of the link - `os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "cloudinary://************************"`
    - In Heroku:
      - Add DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC to Heroku Config Vars (temporary step for the moment, will be removed before deployment - e.g. `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC`, `1`
    - In settings.py:
      - Add Cloudinary Libraries to installed apps - 
        ```python                                            
        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            …,
            'cloudinary_storage',
            'django.contrib.staticfiles',
            'cloudinary',
            …,
        ]
        ```
        (note: order is important)
      - Tell Django to use Cloudinary to store media and static files (Place under the Static files) - 
        ```python
        STATIC_URL = '/static/'

        STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
        STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]
        STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

        MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
        DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
        ```
      - Link file to the templates directory in Heroku (Place under the BASE_DIR line) - 
        `TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')`
      - Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR (Place within the TEMPLATES array) - 
        ```python
        TEMPLATES = [
          {
            …,
            'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR],
            …,
          },
        ]
        ```
      - Add Heroku Hostname to ALLOWED_HOSTS - `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['marblog.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']`
    - In Gitpod:
      - Create 3 new folders on top level directory - media, static, templates
      - Create procfile on the top level directory - Procfile
    - In Procfile:
      - Add code - `web: gunicorn marblog.wsgi`
    - Note: Save all files
    -  In the Terminal:
      - Add, Commit and Push - 
      ```bash
      git add .
      git commit -m "Deployment Commit"
      git push
